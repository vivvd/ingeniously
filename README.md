# Ingeniously

Ingeniously is a React-based web application that provides you with a random song from Spotify.

## How It Works

1. **Random Word Generation**: The application starts by requesting a random word from [Random Word API](http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/). This word serves as the basis for the song search.

2. **Spotify Web API Integration**: The random word is then passed to the Spotify Web API, which searches for a song based on the provided word. You can find more about the Spotify Web API [here](https://developer.spotify.com/).

3. **Displaying Song Information**: The application displays various details about the selected song, including its name, artist, album, and album cover.
